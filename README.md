Simple Linear Regression on the Iris Dataset

Linear Regression Overview: Simple Linear Regression is a statistical technique used to model the relationship between two variables by fitting a linear equation to the observed data. In this case, we attempt to predict a single dependent variable (or target) based on one independent variable (or feature). The aim is to find a line that best fits the data points, minimizing the residual sum of squares (the distance between the actual data points and the predicted values).

Applying Simple Linear Regression to the Iris Dataset

Iris Dataset Overview: The Iris dataset is a well-known dataset containing measurements of four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) for three different species of the Iris flower. For simplicity in this linear regression task, we'll predict one feature (such as petal length) based on another feature (such as sepal length). I have used the necessary libraries to to this project.
